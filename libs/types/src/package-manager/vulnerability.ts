/**
 * A single security advisory discovered during a dependency audit.

 * the issue.
 *
 * @see {@link AuditResult} for the container that holds all vulnerabilities.
 * @see {@link PackageManager.audit} for the method that discovers them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const vuln: Vulnerability = {
 *   package: "lodash",
 *   severity: "high",
 *   description: "Prototype Pollution in lodash",
 *   fixAvailable: "4.17.21",
 * };
